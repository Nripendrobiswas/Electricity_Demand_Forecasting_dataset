# Electricity Demand Forecasting
 We have collected the daily electric demand from Bangladesh Power Development Board. We collected electricity demand from 01-01-2016 to 05-06-2021, totaling 1983 entries. As we know Bangladesh is a country with eight major regions under the subtropical monsoon. The country’s nine separate power zones are operated to control the population’s demand for electricity. We collected data to forecast load demands for the Sylhet area exclusively. Meteorological data, including daily maximum temperature, daily lowest temperature, daily mean temperature, relative
 humidity, rainfall, and wind speed, were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) during the same date range as the electricity demand data.
